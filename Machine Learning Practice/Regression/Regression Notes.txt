Support Vector Linear Regression:
- SVR gives us the flexibility to define how much error is acceptable in our model and will find an appropriate line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to fit the data
- Minimize coefficient rather than Error
- Error is handled by max error boundary set.
- Max Error can be tuned for accuracy
